# Meals

In this application the user can view meals per category, mark them as favorite and use filters to show a subselection of the meals.

During this application I learned how to navigate to screens with Navigator and add new screens with the push() function and remove screens with the pop() function. Furthermore, I learned to add and build my own sidedrawer with the Drawer widget. Also, I worked with providers to manage the state of values which can be consumed anywhere in your application. Lastly, I learned how to implement animations with the help of AnimatedBuilder.
